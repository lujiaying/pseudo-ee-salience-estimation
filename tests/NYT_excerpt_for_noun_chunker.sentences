Don’t worry.
It’s totally natural.
There’s no mother ship hovering above the earth, waiting to carry you away, and no demon shooting light from beneath, signaling to pull you below.
It’s a light pillar — or a few of them — a colorful column of sparkling light that appears to beam up toward the sky.
It’s all just an icy illusion.
And now, during winter, when nights are long and cold, you have a good chance to spot one as long as conditions are right.
If you’re lucky enough to spot a light pillar , what you’re seeing is actually artificial light from a ground source reflecting off millions of floating ice crystals.
“It’s not an upward beam of light,” said Les Cowley, a physicist who runs a website on atmospheric optics, or the way light travels through the atmosphere.
“Although they look pretty, they’re also a sign that someone, somewhere could do better with their lighting.
You might call them light pollution pillars if you wanted to be environmental about it.” Light pillars occur when ice-containing clouds — normally miles high in the atmosphere — cling closer to the Earth’s surface, just a hundred or a few thousand feet above it.
These thin clouds contain millions of flat, hexagonal crystals of ice that float horizontally in the air Each ice crystal acts like a mirror pointed downward, reflecting the artificial light back to your eyes — as long as the cloud is about halfway between you and the light source.
Together, the crystals form a cluster of mirrors floating at different heights, which allows you to see the light as a column; if they all were at the same level, you’d see only a spot of light.
The pillars can be quite colorful at times because each reflected beam is the same color as its source.
To find a good source — one bright, close to the ground, and just far enough away — your best bet is to travel a few miles outside your city or town on a dark night.
The weather doesn’t have to be frigid, but it helps.
Light pillars are frequently spotted in Scandinavia, upstate New York, Canada and other cold spots in the winter.
But Dr. Cowley said that this week he received a photo of light pillars from about 30 miles outside of a town in Iran — perhaps because the desert can get cold at night.
If leaving the city is not an option, look up at streetlights on a freezing cold night.
You may spot the sparkly, ghostly blur of diamond dust.
This illusion is created by the same flat ice crystals that produce light pillars, but this time, they’re so low to the ground you can feel them prickling your skin.
“When that happens, you see other nearby halos, and it’s quite a spectacular sight,” Dr. Cowley said.
SINCE 2001, when President Bush signed the federal No Child Left Behind law, schools in Connecticut have scrambled to revamp curriculums, step up professional development for teachers and continually assess students’ test scores to comply with the law’s requirements.
It is an effort that has dominated the agendas of school officials not just in Connecticut, but all over the nation, and not everyone is happy that test results have become such a focus.
When results of the latest test scores were announced a few weeks ago, about 40 percent, or 408, of the public schools in Connecticut did not make the grade under the federal law, state officials said.
The state added 100 schools to its list of schools that failed to meet the federal benchmarks.
Mark K. McQuillan, commissioner of education for Connecticut, said he does not believe the federal goals are attainable for Connecticut schools.
“I think they’re just unrealistic,” he said in an interview last week.
“And the evidence shows that’s true everywhere in the country.
“It’s too much to expect of the country to do that kind of fundamental changing in the time frame and with the dollars they’ve provided,” he said, referring to the federal government.
The law calls for all students in the United States, including English language learners and students with special needs, to perform at grade level by 2014.
Some officials complain that because the standards are raised every two years, more and more schools are failing to fulfill the law’s requirements.
But that does not mean the state will not keep working hard to meet the goals, Mr. McQuillan said.
The State Department of Education has introduced a new accountability system that assigns teams and support personnel to struggling districts, and helps districts put improvement plans into action, state officials said.
And the strategy is working in some districts.
Two elementary schools in Norwalk found out that they had finally come off the list of schools “in need of improvement.” Brookside Elementary and Kendall Elementary schools were in a group of only five elementary schools statewide that improved enough to meet this year’s standards.
Salvatore J. Corda, superintendent of Norwalk Public Schools, said the improvements came after systemic shifts in teaching and methodology that the district had been working on for a couple of years.
“When you try to move an entire system, it takes a while for things to take hold,” he said.
When Tony Ditrio took over as principal of Kendall Elementary School 10 years ago, his first piece of business was getting order in the building.
“There wasn’t any,” he said.
“That took a few years.
Once we had a safe, orderly environment, we started to tackle the curriculum.” All of the most recent data is based on scores from testing of 230,000 third through eighth graders and 50,000 tenth graders last spring.
The latest results show that keeping children reading at grade level is “a real and growing challenge,” Mr. McQuillan said.
At the high school level, he said, “mathematics is the greater issue.” This year, for the first time, the Greenwich school district as a whole did not make adequate yearly progress.
The district is one of 44 of the state’s 171 districts that did not meet this year’s standards.
Districts are considered not making adequate progress when certain student groups fail to meet benchmarks in the same category on both the elementary and high school tests.
Students with disabilities and economically disadvantaged students in Greenwich did not score at grade level in both reading and math.
“Does this mean we have a bad school system?” said Betty J. Sternberg, superintendent of Greenwich Public Schools.
“The strength of a school system does lie in meeting the needs of each child, no matter what their background is.
So to that extent if I’m a parent of a child in a subgroup that hasn’t met it,” she said, referring to the standards, “I would be concerned.” Special education students should not be expected to perform at grade level, Dr. Sternberg said.
“We’ve had reports of special ed students sitting in front of tests and they’re crying.
They can’t possibly do it,” she said.
Additionally, testing students every year between third and eighth grade leaves schools inundated with data that needs to be analyzed and reported, said Dr. Sternberg, who served as Connecticut’s commissioner for education from 2003 to 2006.
While some teachers and school administrators complain about the tests, others say the law has forced them to take action.
“No Child Left Behind has been a really good kick in the pants for us,” said Joshua P. Starr, superintendent of schools in Stamford.
“It was too easy to sweep some kids under the rug.
We’re not allowed to do that anymore, and that’s a good thing.” Connecticut’s attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, sued the Bush administration in 2005, charging that No Child Left Behind illegally requires states to spend their own money to meet the law’s standards.
A federal judge threw out the case last April, and Mr. Blumenthal is appealing that decision.
The state’s appeal is likely to be argued next spring, according to Mr. Blumenthal’s staff.
